| Priority | Goals |
|----------|-------|
| **Must Have** | 1. Functional Prototype: Complete and fully functional prototype of the cyberdeck-inspired design that integrates predictive policing data visualization. |
|              | 2. Core Systems Operational: Ensure that the main systems (database, user interface) are fully operational and interact seamlessly. |
|              | 3. Basic User Interaction: Essential user interactions, such as navigating through data points or triggering data visualization sequences, must be tested and functional. |
| **Should Have** | 1. Enhanced Aesthetics: Improve the visual design of the interface and hardware to align with the cyberpunk aesthetic, enhancing the overall appeal for the showcase. |
|                | 2. Advanced User Features: Develop additional interactive features that allow users to manipulate or explore the data in more depth, enhancing engagement. |
|                | 3. Documentation: Comprehensive documentation of the design process, system architecture, and user guide. |
| **Could Have** | 1. Extended Datasets: Incorporate a broader range of data sets to showcase the capabilities of predictive policing technologies. |
|                | 2. Interactive Educational Tools: Include interactive elements or educational tools that help explain the concepts and implications of predictive policing to viewers. |
|                | 3. Feedback Mechanisms: Implement systems for gathering user feedback during the showcase to inform future improvements. |
| **Wonâ€™t Have** | 1. Full Scalability: While important, scaling the system for wide deployment will not be feasible within the scope of this initial project phase. |
|                | 2. Complex Machine Learning Algorithms: Advanced predictive algorithms may be considered for future versions but will not be included in the current scope due to complexity and development time constraints. |
|                | 3. Multi-platform Compatibility: Ensuring the prototype works across multiple platforms (e.g., mobile devices) will not be prioritized for the showcase. |
