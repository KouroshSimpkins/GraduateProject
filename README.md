# Graduation Project 2024 - Gotham's Shadow

## Introduction

My final piece of work for my creative computing course at the University of the Arts London's Creative Computing Institute
is an exploration of surveillance systems, in particular how the police use surveillance systems on civilian populations.
My research itself delves into systems built by organisations like Palantir, and how these systems erode civil liberties,
and track individuals regardless of whether they are under direct surveillance by a governmental organisation.

## The Systems

Of course, I can't build a system that tracks real people, so I'm using a series of generative systems to simulate the
identities of people that might be tracked by a system like Palantir's Gotham. 

| Generative Systems    |   |
|-----------------------|---|
| Fingerprint Generator | âœ… |
| Vehicle Generator     |   |
| Face Generator        |   |
| Identity Generator    |   |
| Housing Generator     |   |

I can finish this when I finish the rest of the code I reckon.
